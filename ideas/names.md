# Underground Tower Defense

## Theme

What kind of age is the game evolving around?
Is there a magic system? Magic could be in any of the times, primitive runes or magical resources which has be farmed in space.


- Space, advanced technology, androids
- modern, our technology, humans
- medieval, simple technology
- primitive, basic tools
- magic?
- Human race, d&d, aliens, completely different?


## Concepts

Some concepts of games I love:

#### fortresscraft evolved
3D, crashed on a planet, mining resources with drills and conveyor belts.
Ground has different layers with different resources, enemies and effects on the player.
Primary enemies: Insects will come in waves to destroy your capsule.
Secondary enemies: Hiveminds will spawn parasites on conveyor belts, eating resources feeding the hivemind which then will grow tendrils with resin that is hard to get ridd off.

#### Dwarf fortress
Very old colony game with basic graphic where you only instruct dwarfs to do stuff and assign areas etc. The AI felt quite lively and was fun to watch and influence. A lot of interaction with the colony

#### Factorio
enemies more aggresive the more machines player has built.
"feed the factory" like game.
enemies prevent expanding


### What do they have in common?

- addictive, always something to do
- having elements that create, process and consume resources
- enemies that require some attention but game could be played without them
- little exploring (exploring gets boring fast in most procedural created games)
- advancement through technology or skill
- variety in resource type (energy, fluid, money, ore)
- heavy load on machine after some time
- can feel like an idle game if player is not expanding
- figthing with walls and turrets

### Favorite elements

- enemies from fortresscraft (hivemind and worm)
- trains from factorio
- pollution from factorio
- AI from dwarf fortress

## Idea


Train fell with tracks down a crack in earth.
Train serves as base containing basic machinery and inventory
Instead of focusing on mining passages, we fell into a giant ravine with cave systems.
Enemies are attracted by sound (Definitely not inspired by dune) that dig through the ground and maybe even create passages for us.
Instead of fighting enemies, we need to keep them at bay by having noice cancelling towers or frequencies they don't like.

Main goal is to get back to the surface again for which we need to place train tracks (main resource consumers). Different tracks produce different sound which might attract specific enemies in specific locations.
(Maybe pretend that every 10 blocks east, goes some levels up)

Ore patches are scattered around the caves.
