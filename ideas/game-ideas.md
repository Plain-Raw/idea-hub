## card game

Maybe a mythic card game with shiny cards. Pack opening with points a player can earn.
A player earns points when progressing in the modes

Modes:
- infinite
- multiplayer?
- story?

A player has life points
A card has life points that can go down
A card has attack points
You may play three cards on the field?

## an auto fighter game

The player needs to fight rounds to proceed.

The player can get new champions and can upgrade them
The player can fight a level as many times he want
The player can level up to get now kind of champions
Champion positioning matters
After placed and started a fight a player can only observe
Champions can be given weapons, armor or whatever
The foes are leaving loot after a battle

## a zombie shooter

Not sure if top down or if we are capable of create a 3d game yet

Just fighting hords with diffrent weapons from a rooftop
Killing as many as possible
You can not die but you may upgrade weapons?
