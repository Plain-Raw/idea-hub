# game ideas

## card game

Maybe a mythic card game with shiny cards. Pack opening with points a player can earn.
A player earns points when progressing in the modes

Modes:
- infinite
- multiplayer?
- story?

A player has life points
A card has life points that can go down
A card has attack points
You may play three cards on the field?

## an auto fighter game

The player needs to fight rounds to proceed.

The player can get new champions and can upgrade them
The player can fight a level as many times he want
The player can level up to get now kind of champions
Champion positioning matters
After placed and started a fight a player can only observe
Champions can be given weapons, armor or whatever
The foes are leaving loot after a battle

## a zombie shooter

Not sure if top down or if we are capable of create a 3d game yet

Just fighting hords with diffrent weapons from a rooftop
Killing as many as possible
You can not die but you may upgrade weapons?

## A factory underground

Factorio like game with tower defense elements.
You are trapped deep underground and need to build something?
Evolves around minecarts or trains and machines.
There are giant worms and termites wandering around the map which might attack you if you create too much noice/vibration with your machines.
You might install noisecancelling towers to lessen the vibration around your base but at some point you need to consider dealing with the critters differently.
There are ore veins and other minerals that you can use. 
These games always need something which consumes the resources. e.g. science, colony, shipment to home planet, ammunition, etc.
